# DEPRECATION NOTICE

I have decided to deprecate this package as I no longer have the time to maintain it.  It was originally a proof of concept and an example of how to use tokio at the time.  I've since been unable to fully maintain this package to the standards I feel are necessary.  There's plenty of other great IRC client libraries out there for rust, though.  I do plan to actively maintain the sister project [pircolate](https://github.com/Mr-Byte/pircolate) which is used to parse and construct IRC messages.

If you would like to take ownership of this project and maintain it please file an issue.
